             <p>Vexana was the majestic ruler of Necrokeep, the gentle mother of the undead. She was also the only glimmer of light that pierced through the Mist, bringing hope to a land forsaken by both life and death.</p>

            <p>
                Princess Vexana Gaius had never set foot out of Lumina City, nor did she have any desire to do so. The Moniyan capital was warm, opulent, and bursting with life. A ghastly fortress in the southern hinterlands was the last place she intended to spend the rest of her life in.</p>
                <br>
                On the other hand, she knew she was bound to her father's will. Duke Atticus of Ridgeburg had offered the House of Gaius a union through marriage, and Lord Gaius deemed Vexana the most suitable match. And now, she had found herself alone in her carriage on a long ride south.<br>
                <br>
                She glanced over the letter the Duke sent to introduce her to her future home:<br>
                <br>
              <i>These are the southern lands blessed by the old gods, where rainstorms come and go, and silvery grass bathes in the moonlight's glow.</i><br>
                <br>
                Vexana admired the Duke's thoughtfulness, but those poetic words did little to soothe her unease.<br>
