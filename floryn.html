             <p>The despair and sorrow almost consumed him, when a blooming little flower suddenly broke into his sight. "There's still life!" Moved by such tenacious vitality, the treant decided to create what was later known as the Oasis at the place. While creating the Oasis, Belerick unintentionally poured more power into the little flower, and the overflowing energy condensed into a glowing seed. The little flower, however, underwent an even more peculiar transition. It turned into a life form that had never appeared on the Land of Dawn-Floryn.</p>

            <p>
                The despair and sorrow almost consumed him, when a blooming little flower suddenly broke into his sight. "There's still life!" Moved by such tenacious vitality, the treant decided to create what was later known as the Oasis at the place.</p>
                <br>
                While creating the Oasis, Belerick unintentionally poured more power into the little flower, and the overflowing energy condensed into a glowing seed. The little flower, however, underwent an even more peculiar transition. It turned into a life form that had never appeared on the Land of Dawn–Floryn.<br>
                <br>
                Since the day she was born, Floryn had never stepped out of the Oasis. The latter isolated her from the harsh environment of the desert, allowing her to live a life carefree. To Floryn, that glowing seed was the only mystery in her peaceful life. She spent the days contemplating the secret of the seed and the nights sleeping in the shade of the leaves. Only explorers and caravans would occasionally visit this undisturbed little world.<br>
                <br>
                Among the caravans that frequented the Oasis, Floryn met a young man with a dazzling smile. He'd tell Floryn fun stories he'd seen or heard on his journey whenever he came to lodge at the Oasis. As their friendship gradually deepened, Floryn's trust in the young man also grew. She showed the young man the glowing seed, hoping the latter could help her solve the puzzle.<br>
                <br>
                At first, the young man helped Floryn look for info about the seed wholeheartedly. As time went by, however, Floryn found the young man was always avoiding her eyes, and he'd change the subject whenever the seed was brought up. Floryn began to worry about the young man's state.<br>
                <br>
                One night, Floryn woke up with a start. She was shocked to find the seed she'd always carried with her had disappeared!<br>
                <br>
                Floryn searched everywhere in the Oasis but to no avail. Torn with anxiety, Floryn went to ask the young man for help, only to discover he'd already left the Oasis with his camel.<br>
                <br>
                A thought that Floryn dreaded to believe came to her mind – could it be him?<br>
                <br>
                Floryn followed the young man's trail out of the Oasis. She wanted to find out the truth.<br>
                <br>
                However, what awaited her was a silent answer from what she saw and heard along the way. It was the first time Floryn had stepped into the desert, and also the first time she'd seen the howling sandstorms and the look of despair on people's faces. Before that, she'd never understood what kind of suffering people outside the Oasis were going through.<br>
                <br>
                When Floryn caught up with the young man in his village, what came into view were cracked farmland, dried wells, famished kids… and those desperate ones who'd stop at nothing to survive.<br>
                <br>
                The young man was slumped in a corner. He'd wanted to sell the seed to feed his family, but he'd never expected that the seed would wither the moment it left Floryn. As a result, those who'd been willing to bid would pay not a single penny.<br>
                <br>
                The young man returned the withered seed to Floryn, ready to take the blame for betraying their friendship.<br>
                <br>
                Floryn, however, didn't say a word.<br>
                <br>
                The experience along the way had given Floryn a glimpse of the young man's predicament. Compared to the sadness of being betrayed by her friend, another even stronger and more complicated emotion was churning in her heart. Driven by this emotion, Floryn wanted badly to do something for the land, to save the people who lived in extreme misery as the young man did.<br>
                <br>
                A surge of magic power swelled from the bottom of Floryn's heart. It flowed through her arm and poured into the seed in her hand. feeling the power, the once withered seed shone again, and from the light that was a hundred times more dazzling than before popped out a cute and lively little creature!<br>
                <br>
                This little creature leaped out into the air and eagerly showed off its miraculous powers; it summoned rain with just a wave of its tail, and new shoots gradually sprouted from where the rain fell. The once lifeless village was surrounded by greenery in mere minutes.<br>
                <br>
                Floryn's was stunned by the sight in front of her. She'd never imagined the seed could give birth to such a magical creature, just as she'd never thought she'd ever leave the Oasis. It was only when Floryn's resolve to change the desert resonated with Belerick's will inside the seed did the latter awakened its true power.<br>
                <br>
                Although the little creature born from the seed was still very young, from its limited power Floryn saw infinite possibilities of changing the desert.<br>
                <br>
                "You look like a round drop of dew. I should just call you Dew!"<br>
                <br>
                Dew circled Floryn excitedly, as if it also liked the name.<br>
                <br>
                The changes in the environment brought light back to the villager's eyes. The young man also promised Floryn he'd never again err from the right path. Biding the young man farewell, Floryn and Dew moved on to their next stop.<br><br>
                Now, thanks to Floryn and Dew's unremitting efforts, the Oasis is expanding at a considerable speed. And this greenery will eventually spread across the entire desert, dispersing all desolation and despair.
