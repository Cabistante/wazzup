            <p>
                Chou was born in a secluded slum deep in the hearts of poverty, living the lowest quality of life. Despite the dreadful conditions, Chou kept his heart of kindness, as day in and day out he continued to look after the old and the young there with passion. During this time, there was great turmoil and unrest in the Land of the Dawn; mayhem spread throughout the land and eventually started to affect this small remote area.</p>
                <br>
                One day, Chou rescued a mystic monk under pursuit by his captors and took him back to his slum to care for him. In return, the monk imparted the ancient Asian Kung-Fu skill to Chou and told him that the world needed a real hero to stand up and end the chaos. Chou made a vow right then and there that he would start on his journey in the Land of Dawn to become a true hero without looking back. As Chou was leaving, the monk nodded and disappeared into the shadows.
