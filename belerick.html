            <p>
                Many a race has risen and fallen throughout the expansive history of the Land of Dawn. Belerick is one of the few who have borne witness to all this throughout the mists of time. When the world was first formed, the mysterious Ancient Ones aided the Forefathers as they created all things in this universe. Together they constructed the grand and massive Celestial Palace and the myriad elemental creatures, who would live as successors to their bloodlines.</p>
                <br>
                When Belerick was but a young sapling, he was chosen by the Ancient Ones and given the essence of life and Mother Nature; this bestowed upon him the powers of intelligent though, deep wisdom, and the wondrous ability of reincarnation. Under the Ancient Ones' protection he lived together with the elemental creatures within the Lantis Mountain ranges, a place flourishing with life and vitality.<br>
                <br>
                However, this blissful existence would not last long. The Forefathers departed and the Endless War descended upon the lands, plunging the Land of Dawn into the throes of fierce battle and slaughter: the Ancient Ones retreated to the Celestial Palace and the elemental creatures thus lost the protection they'd once been granted. The creatures were left without a safe home of their own, and slain en masse as the fires of war blazed ever on.<br>

The creatures were left without a safe home of their own, and slain en masse as the fires of war blazed ever on.<br>
                <br>
                They were forced to wander the lands for an entire age. Belerick watched as the Land of Dawn was ravaged by the raging war, no corner left untouched by the fighting. As he did so, Belerick grew from a sapling into a mighty tree. The warfare had stripped him of his former life, and hardened his power of will; despite having lost many of his companions in the process, he nonetheless refused to give up the hope he had in life. He sought to use his power to the best of his ability in helping out those weaker than him. In the later stages of the Era of Strife, the Ancient Ones who had returned to their Celestial Palace long ago could no longer stand the pitiable state of the world below, and went against the orders of the Forefathers as they rashly used the Twilight Orbs' power to try and end the war.
